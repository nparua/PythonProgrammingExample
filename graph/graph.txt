An adjacency matrix is a common way of represnting a graph

Adjacency sets and adjacency list are the other ways

two fundamental ways of traversing a graph
 Depth firts and breadth first

 Graph consists of 
 Vertices (entities) and edges (relationships) 

 A graph that is connected but has no cycle is called tree.

 Three common graph problems:
    Establish precedence (Topological Sort)
       Neural network relies on topological sort.
    Getting from Point A to point B (shortest path algorithm)
    Covering all nodes in a graph (Minimum spanning tree algorithm)


 A topological sort is any ordering of all the graph's vertices that satisfies all precedence relationship.

 In-degree is number of nodes directed to the node.

 in a graph if no node has in-degree=0 the graph has a cycle.


 For shortest path algorithm we use Distance table as data structure


 Spanning tree algorithm seeks to cover shortest way to connect all nodes

 Prim's algorithm works for connected graphs

 Kruskal's algorithm works even for unconnected graphs

 Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that works on a weighted undirected, unconnected Graph.
